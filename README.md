# ProjectManager
This is a simple Project Manager for Torque 2D.

You can simply make a new 2D game with Torque 2D and Project Manager.

Just call your future project, add your company, select a folder where Torque 2D is installed, 
choose a folder for your next project then click "Create Project" button.

After that Project Manager creates a simple game for you with scene, scenewindow, input manager and sprite at the center of the screen.

Also Project Manager can create a Torsion project for your game.

You can use Project Manager to begin developing your own games with Torque 2D.

I developed a Project Manager using C#.
